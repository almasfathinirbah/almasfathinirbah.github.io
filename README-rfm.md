# **E-Commerce Behavior Data from Multi Category Store with Python**

## **Business Understanding**

* E-Commerce is a business model that lets firms and individuals buy and sell things over the internet.

* This case has some business question using the data:
* What is the best product to sell in the specific time of the day?
* What is the best Event to predict that User most likely to buy a product?
* How is the behaviour of our repeat user vs new user?

## **Data Understanding**

* Behavior data for October 2019 from a large multi-category online store. Each row in the file represents an event. All events are related to products and users. Each event is like many-to many relation between products and users.

* Source Data: https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store

* Data Dictionary:

* `event_time`: Time when event happened at (in UTC).

* `event_type`: Only one kind of event: purchase.

* `product_id`: ID of a product

* `category_id`: Product's category ID

* `category_code`: Product's category taxonomy (code name) if it was possible to make it. Usually present for meaningful categories and skipped for different kinds of accessories.

* `brand`: Downcased string of brand name. Can be missed.

* `price`: Float price of a product. Present.

* `user_id`: Permanent user ID.

* `user_session`: Temporary user's session ID. Same for each user's session. Is changed every time user come back to online store from a long pause.

* Packages: Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib.

## **Data Cleansing**

* Check for each column and find if any column is redundant or useless.
* Check for missing values.
* Check for outliers.
* Check if the data format is already suitable for algorithm.
* Check for value that are not consistent with general common sense.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis**
